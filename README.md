<h1>XSeek Front-End</h1>
<h3>The front-end for XSeek, an XML-based search engine being developed at NJIT</h3>
<br>
<h2>Things Completed This Week:</h2>
- [x] Rewrote the node-expansion system to be less reliant on the DBLP data set (rewrote a lot of details_new.php).
- [x] Added Bootstrap CSS support to give the site a more modern look.
- [x] Rewrote the feedback/bug report section on search.php to look nicer.
<br>
<h2>Major Things to be Completed:</h2>
- [ ] Fix the formatting of the data on child nodes.
- [ ] Structure the search result output data properly amongst child nodes.
- [ ] Fix the page numbers at the bottom of search.php to display in the correct order (bug occurs on pages above search result page #1).
- [ ] Fix some existing CSS bugs (mostly occur when shrinking the page due to Bootstrap's built-in responsiveness).
<br>
<h2>Things to be Completed if Time Permits:</h2>
- [ ] Add a textbox to view a variable amount of child nodes under a parent node.
- [ ] Add scrollbars under sets of child nodes to quickly navigate through them.
